# Legal Judgments Search System - Accuracy Improvement Summary

## Problem Identified
The AI system provided **factually incorrect information** about the Makhan Singh case (1964 AIR 381). Specifically:
- **Incorrect Summary**: Claimed the case was about "criminal conviction" and "identity confirmation"
- **Actual Case**: Constitutional law case about emergency powers and preventive detention under the Defence of India Act, 1962

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Misclassification**: System incorrectly classified the case type
2. **Poor Headnote Extraction**: Failed to properly extract and analyze the actual headnote
3. **Lack of Verification**: No cross-referencing with original PDF documents
