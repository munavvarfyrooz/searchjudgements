# Accuracy Verification Summary: Makhan Singh Case

## Executive Summary
✅ **COMPLETED**: Successfully verified and corrected the AI-generated summary for the Makhan Singh case (1964 AIR 381). The original AI response was **factually incorrect**, and we have now implemented a verified accurate system.

## Problem Identified
The original AI response claimed:
> "The Supreme Court upheld the Tribunal's findings confirming Makhan Singh's identity with a convicted person..."

**This was completely wrong.** The actual case is about **constitutional law and preventive detention**, not criminal conviction.

## Verified Accurate Information

### Case Details
- **Case Name**: Makhan Singh vs State of Punjab
- **Citation**: 1964 AIR 381
- **Case Type**: Constitutional Law - Emergency Powers & Preventive Detention

### Actual Headnote (Verified from PDF)
> "The appellants were detained under r. 30(l) of the Defence of India Rules made by the Central Government under s. 3 of the Defence of India Ordinance, 1962. They applied to the Punjab and Bombay High Courts under s. 491(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and their case was that ss. 3(2)(15)(i) and 40 of the Defence of India Act, 1962, and r. 30(1)(b) of the Defence of India Rules, which were continued under the Act, were unconstitutional and invalid inasmuch as they contravened their fundamental rights under Arts. 14, 21, 22(4), (5) and (7) of the Constitution..."

### Key Constitutional Issues
1. **Validity of preventive detention during emergency**
2. **Scope of Article 21** (Right to Life and Personal Liberty)
3. **Application of Article 22** (Protection against arbitrary arrest)
4. **Constitutionality of Defence of India Act provisions**
